#### 1. Problem Description
The business analytics group of a company is asked to investigate causes of malfunctions in technological process of one 
of the manufacturing plants that result in significant increase of cost for the end product of the business.

One of suspected reasons for malfunctions is deviation of temperature during the technological process from optimal levels. 
The sample in the provided file contains times of malfunctions in seconds since the start of measurement and minute records 
of temperature.

####  2 . Data
The csv file contains time stamps of events expressed in seconds.  

#### 3. Create Counting Process, Explore Cumulative Intensity


#### 4. Check for over-dispersion.


#### 4.1 Methods for Testing Over-Dispersion

#### 5. Find the distribution of Poisson intensity

### 6. Explore possible types of dependence between one-minute counts and temperature.

#### 7. Fit a copula. What can you tell about the relationship between the temperature and the counts?
